# User-Interface
Being able to create a user interface from scratch based on a design file is considered a basic necessity for front end developers. We will be building a single page website using HTML and CSS.

Given this design file, use HTML and CSS to build the web page layout. Remember, you can only use display:inline-block and box model CSS properties for this project. Note: you are NOT permitted to use Flexbox or CSS Grid. This is an exercise in basic layout techniques.
